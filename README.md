# 📱 Personal Mobile Cloud Storage

A lightweight **personal cloud storage system** that runs directly on an **Android mobile phone (up to Android 11)**. This project turns your phone into a private cloud server, allowing you to store, manage, and access files securely—without relying on third‑party cloud providers.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📦 Self‑hosted cloud storage on your own mobile phone
* 🔐 Full control over your data (no third‑party cloud dependency)
* 🌍 Secure remote access from anywhere
* ⚡ Lightweight and mobile‑friendly setup
* 🆓 Uses open‑source tools only

---

## 📱 Platform Support

* **Android version:** Up to Android 11
* **Device type:** Android smartphone
* **Root required:** ❌ No

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Android App (Local Server)** – The app itself creates and runs the local server on the mobile device
* **Termux** (from F‑Droid) – Used **only for tunneling purposes**, not for hosting the server
* **zrok** – Secure tunneling to expose the app’s local server to the internet

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. The **Android app** creates and runs a local server directly on the mobile device.
2. Files are stored securely within the phone’s internal storage or SD card.
3. **Termux** is used **only to run zrok** for tunneling purposes.
4. **zrok** securely exposes the app’s local server to the internet.
5. The private cloud can then be accessed from anywhere using a secure link.

---

## 📌 Important Note

> 🔔 **Remote Access Architecture**
>
> The local server is **entirely handled by the Android app itself**. **Termux (installed via F‑Droid)** is used **only for running zrok**, which securely tunnels the app’s local server to the public internet. This design keeps the app independent while still enabling global access to your private cloud storage.

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

* Data remains stored only on your personal device
* zrok provides encrypted tunneling
* Access links can be rotated or revoked
* Optional authentication can be added at the application level

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

* Personal cloud storage alternative
* Backup server for important files
* File sharing between personal devices
* Learning project for mobile self‑hosting

## 🌐 Steps to Make Personal Storage Publicly Accessible

Follow these steps to securely expose your personal cloud storage to the internet.

---

### 1️⃣ Install Termux

1. Open **F-Droid** (recommended source)
2. Search for **Termux** and install it
3. Launch Termux and allow storage permission when prompted

> ⚠️ Play Store versions of Termux are deprecated. Always use F-Droid.

---

### 2️⃣ Install Ubuntu Inside Termux

Run the following commands **inside Termux**:

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install proot-distro -y
proot-distro install ubuntu
proot-distro login ubuntu
```

Once logged in, you will be inside the Ubuntu environment.

---

### 3️⃣ Install and Configure zrok

Run the following commands **inside Ubuntu**:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install curl unzip -y
```

Download and install zrok:

```bash
curl -s https://get.openziti.io/install.bash | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Verify installation:

```bash
zrok version
```

Authenticate and enable zrok (one-time setup):

```bash
zrok enable
```

Follow the browser-based authentication and complete device enrollment.

---

### 4️⃣ Run the Android App Local Server

1. Open your **Personal Cloud Storage app**
2. Start the local server from within the app
3. Note the **local server URL** shown by the app (example: `http://192.168.1.1:8080`)

> 📝 **Local Access Note**
> The web interface can be accessed **locally on the same network** using the link provided by the app. Any device connected to the same Wi‑Fi network can open this URL in a browser to access the storage locally.

The app now serves files locally on your device.

---

### 5️⃣ Share the Local Server Using zrok

Assuming your app provides a local server like:

```
http://192.168.1.1:8080
```

[http://localhost:PORT](http://localhost:PORT)

````

Run the following command **inside Ubuntu**:

```bash
zrok share public localhost:PORT
````

zrok will generate a **secure public URL**.

---

### 6️⃣ Access Your Personal Cloud from Anywhere

* Open the zrok-generated public URL in any browser
* Your mobile-hosted cloud storage is now accessible globally
* All data continues to reside only on your phone

> 🔁 **Keep-Alive Note (Important)**
>
> To ensure the server stays active:
>
> * Create a **new session/tab in Termux**
> * Run a `curl` request to the **zrok public URL every 10 seconds**
>
> Example:
>
> ```bash
> while true; do curl <PUBLIC_ZROK_URL>; sleep 10; done
> ```
>
> This prevents the tunnel or session from becoming idle and helps keep the server reachable.
